# Algorithms

**Problem**: Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding if a string matches any previously added string.

Here's a list of algorithms that can be used to solved the problem.

## Trie

Store words in a Trie, use one node for each letter.

**Solutions:**

* [Javascript](javascript/211.js)

**Complexity:**

N = word length

* Time:
  * add: O(N)
  * search: O(N)

* Space:
  * add: O(N)
  * search: O(1)
