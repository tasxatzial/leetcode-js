# Algorithms

See the problem description on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).

Here's a list of algorithms that were used in the solutions.

## Binary search

1. Sort the array.

2. If (Y) is an element of the array, its difference from the (target) is (target - Y). Therefore we can use binary search to find (target - Y).

**Solutions:**

* [Javascript](javascript/1.js)

**Complexity:**

N = array length

* Time: O(NlogN)
* Space: O(N)

## Hash map

**Solutions:**

* [Javascript](javascript/1-2.js)

**Complexity:**

N = array length

* Time: O(N)
* Space: O(N)
